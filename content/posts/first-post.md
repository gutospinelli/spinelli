Hi, everyone!

If you came here you are probably thinking about **hire me**, follow and **support my work** or just stalking... 

No matter what reason, you came to the right place. 

This is my personal website, where I plan do **share some of my work**, projects I've been to and my passions: bycicles, tech and books!

This site is not supposed to be updated regularly, whenever I feel I should update it, I will. 

### Now the real post begins!

I am currently in love with some awesome technologies:

**Pandas** - The place to start if you wanna become a DataScientist using Python

Wanna know more? 
https://pandas.pydata.org/

**ElasticSearch** - Tool I've started using in my formal work, that I rapidly felt in love with. The fastest, reliable, RESTful and out-of-the-box way to perform search.  

More? 
https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/

Not really clear? Try this video that explains in a bit what Elastic is and what it can do for you:

That's all folks! Bye Bye and see you in my next post.
