I am a **Software Engineer** with more than **ten years of experience** in a multitude of environments and technologies, including *digital television, software auditing, Microsoft technologies, full-stack web development and ElasticSearch*.

As a hobby I like to be involved in Data Intelligence projects, working on all steps from *Exploratory Data Analysis* to *Predictive Models*, *Machine Learning* and beautiful *Visualizations*.

I enjoy living different experiences in life and work, and I see computer science as an instrument to improve people's lives through the use of technology and a wonderful user experience.

I am looking for a place where I can **expand my knowledge and learn** from world-class engineers.
