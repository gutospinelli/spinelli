I am a **Software Engineer** with more than **ten years of experience** in a multitude of environments and technologies, including digital television, software auditing, proof of concept in Microsoft technologies and full-stack web development.

I enjoy living different experiences in life and work and I see computer science as an instrument to improve people's lives through the use of technology and a wonderful user experience.

I am looking for a place where I can **expand my knowledge and learn** from world-class engineers.
